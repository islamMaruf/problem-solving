1. 10 lakh loop can be iterrate in 1 sec in uva machine
2. Binary search need to sorted
3. While loop is used when we do not know how many times we need to iterrate
4. switch case is faster than for loop and tarnary operator is faster than switch case 
5. flooring/celling in Binary search
6. same value number of occurance  of target value 

## Time complexity

O(1) -> constant Time
O(n) -> Linear time
O(n^2) ->  quadratic time
O(logN) -> logarithm time

Binary search
arr = [20,30,40,50,60];
let assume a target value 57
57 is not is the array
its flooring value is 50 and celling value is 60
if sorted array then always binary search
flooring and celling is always in binary search

Linked List
HEAD ------------------------------- TAIL
(100, 2K)---------->(200, 3k)----------->(300,NULL)

    HEAD {
        value: 100,
        next: {
            value: 200,
            next: {

    }

Two types of linked List
1. Single Linked List
2. Double Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
